Project Overview
This project involved the creation of the official website for the Aspirant India Initiative from March to July 2025. The primary goal was to establish a professional, engaging, and accessible online platform to clearly communicate the initiative's mission, provide valuable resources, and connect with its community of aspirants.

The Development Process
The website was built using a structured, user-centric approach.

Design & Prototyping: The process began in Figma, where I created wireframes and high-fidelity mockups. This established a clear visual direction and user flow, focusing on a clean, modern, and intuitive interface.

Platform Choice: Wix was selected as the development platform to facilitate rapid development and to empower the Aspirant India Initiative team with an easy-to-use system for future content management without needing technical expertise.

Development: I translated the Figma designs into a fully functional and responsive website using the Wix Editor. This involved customizing layouts, structuring all pages, setting up a blog for updates, and integrating a contact form for inquiries.

SEO & Launch: I implemented on-page SEO best practices using the Wix SEO Wiz toolkit. This included keyword optimization for page titles and descriptions, adding alt text to all images, and ensuring a mobile-friendly structure. The site was thoroughly tested across desktop and mobile devices before its successful launch.

Key Features
Fully Responsive Design: The site is optimized for a seamless experience on all devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

Clear & Intuitive Navigation: A logical site structure allows users to easily find information about the initiative's mission, team, and resources.

Contact Form: A simple and effective form for users to make inquiries and connect with the team.
